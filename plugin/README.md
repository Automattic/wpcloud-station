# WP Cloud Station

Connects to the WP Cloud to create a WP Cloud Station.


### Block Development
To get started working on the plugin block switch to the `blocks` directory, set up node, and run the start command:
```
$ cd ./blocks
$ npm i
$ npm start
```
This will generate the build with source maps for developing.

When ready to package run
```
$ npm run build
```
